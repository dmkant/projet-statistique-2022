Make.org is an organization that aims to involve and mobilize citizens in order to positively transform our so-
ciety. Citizens are therefore asked to give their opinion on a wide range of subjects concerning our society. We worked on this project with
the aim of facilitating the study of proposals made by citizens.
The platform proposes a theme and citizens are invited to make their own proposals and react to those of other
participants. In order to bring out the main ideas, a study must be carried out by Make.org. Currently, this step is
done manually. The objective of our project was to automate this step.
First, we studied all the proposals of the theme we had at our disposal : ”How to act together now for the
environment ?”. Then, we carried out several researches on all the NLP and clustering techniques. This allowed us
to set up several algorithms and to compare them. In the end, we determined the method that seemed the most
efficient to study and classify all the proposals.
